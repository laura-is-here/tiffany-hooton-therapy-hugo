# What To Expect

My approach to therapy is humanistic, gender-affirming, and incorporates elements of cognitive therapy to challenge unhelpful or self-defeating thought patterns.

My specialty areas include working with queer, trans, and nonbinary individuals and their partners as they navigate identity, transition, and relationship issues.

## Fees

My full fee is $100 per 50-minute session - However, in order to help make therapy more accessible, I do offer a sliding scale starting at $65 for those with limited resources. 

As an Associate, I am unable to accept insurance at this time.
