## What To Expect from Therapy

My approach to therapy is _humanistic, gender-affirming_, and incorporates elements of _cognitive_ and _narrative therapy_ to challenge ways of thinking and internalized messages which negatively impact our views of ourselves, others, and our world.

In the therapy office, I typically assume a role that is collaborative, active, and engaged, with room for the client to lead the session. This is because I believe that therapy centers on _you._ In our hour together, _you_ have the power to decide where the session goes.

Finally, I strive to serve people of all ethnic, racial, and class backgrounds with sensitivity and humility. When I am sitting across the room (or computer screen) from my clients, I always try my best to account for and be aware of my own biases, including my status as an abled, white woman. My populations of interest are queer, trans, and nonbinary individuals and their partners as they navigate identity, transition, relational issues, self-esteem, and beyond.

### Fees

<<<<<<< HEAD
For information on fees, please visit [my profile at Prospect Therapy and contact me](https://www.prospecttherapy.com/meet-tiffany).
=======
My full fee is $100 per 50-minute session - HOWEVER, in order to help make therapy more accessible, I do offer a sliding scale starting for those with limited resources. If you require a lower fee,  I will try my best to accommodate your needs or link you to an alternate provider who can.

_While I wish to make my services as accessible as possible, I am unable to accept insurance at this time._
