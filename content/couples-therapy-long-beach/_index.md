## Anxious about couples therapy?

Going to therapy with your partner(s) can be daunting. Sometimes, people have the idea that couples therapy is a last resort -- a death knell of a dying relationship or sign of failure. Some might fear that the therapist will inevitably take sides and favor one partner's story over the other. Others still dread a judgemental therapist who sticks their nose up at relationships that don't exactly follow the rules of normative romance -- queer, polyamourous, kink, what?

I'm here to tell you that, although these scenarios are rare, having anxiety about seeking help in your relationship is normal -- but don't let those fears deter you from finding support when you need it!

## So, what can you actually expect? 

A safe, nonjudgemental space. When I work with couples, one of my first (and ongoing) priorities is seeing to the emotional and physical safety of all partners. 

You can expect to learn and practice new skills with your partner. In couples therapy, it's not uncommon to learn new things about yourself, your partner(s), and new ways of interacting. Therapy is also a space to put those newly learned skills to use. 

You can expect some discomfort. Discomfort and conflict is, often, a necessary part of working through issues in couples therapy. When things heat up, it can be hard to keep going, but sometimes there is a breakthrough waiting to happen. Remember, I will be there to de-escalate, moderate, and help cool things down. 

Sure, it's chaos -- but controlled chaos!

### Communication

The number one area my clients want help with in their relationships is communication -- and for good reason. The way in which we communicate, verbally or nonverbally, with people plays a significant role in the quality of our interactions. Couples therapy is an excellent environment to evaluate if our way of communicating is facilitating openness and intimacy or if it is pushing our partner(s) away. 

That said, communicate isn't just about what we say and how we say it. Communicate is also about how we understand the messages our partner is sending up. Even the most carefully articulated communication can get lost in translation.
