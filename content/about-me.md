I am a queer and gender affirming therapist based in Long Beach, CA. After graduating from California State University, Long Beach, with an undergrad degree in sociology, I decided to pursue my Masters of Science in Counseling at California State University, Fullerton. My dual education in sociology and counseling, as well as my own life experiences and identities, have informed my current therapeutic areas of interest and practice with my clients.

As a result, I aim to provide all of my clients with a warm, safe, and affirming space to explore their most authentic selves. In our society, trans and queer folks face a myriad of stressors that may leave them feeling that the systems in place have let them down. This translates to an accumulation of stressful or traumatic experiences and relational struggles wherein feelings of low self-worth, shame, distrust, hurt, and anger fester. In therapy, I hope to help my clients overcome these feelings while building a sense of empowerment and authenticity, so they feel ready to build meaningful relationships with others and pursue their goals.

In order to achieve this, I largely work from a humanistic lens. This means that I believe in my clients' intrinsic worth as human beings, position my clients as the expert of their own lives, and emphasize the role of choice, self-awareness, and empathy to facilitate change. Additionally, I also incorporate elements of cognitive and narrative therapy (challenging unhelpful thought patterns/internal narratives) depending on the client's unique treatment needs.

I am a bisexual, nonbinary woman and use she/her and they/them pronouns.
