## What happens in couples therapy?

Going to therapy with your partner can be daunting, and people often want to know what to expect during a session of couples therapy.

I'm not the kind of therapist who likes to dictate what happens during a session ahead of time, as I believe in working with my clients to address the needs that you are bringing to the table.

However, there are a few things you can count on.

### Tell your own story

The stories we tell ourselves about our relationships affect the way we view ourselves and our partner(s).

Couples therapy can be a time to talk about that story in your own words and break out of the ideas that keep you stuck in unhelpful ways of relating to your loved one(s).

### Listen and be heard

Couples therapy is a chance to say the things you need to say in a supportive environment.

It's also a chance to listen deeply to your partner.

Listening is an essential tool in our relationships. Only by listening to one another can we respond to our partner's needs.
