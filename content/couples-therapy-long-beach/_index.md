## Anxious about couples therapy?

Going to therapy with your partner(s) can be daunting. Sometimes, people have the idea that couples therapy is a last resort -- a death knell of a dying relationship or sign of failure. Some might fear that the therapist will inevitably take sides and favor one partner's story over the other. Others still dread a judgemental therapist who sticks their nose up at relationships that don't exactly follow the rules of normative romance -- queer, polyamourous, kink, what?

I'm here to tell you that, although these scenarios are rare, having anxiety about seeking help in your relationship is normal -- but don't let those fears deter you from finding support when you need it!

## So, what can you actually expect? 

A safe, nonjudgemental space. When I work with couples, one of my first (and ongoing) priorities is seeing to the emotional and physical safety of all partners. 

You can expect to learn and practice new skills with your partner. In couples therapy it's not uncommon to learn new things about yourself, your partner(s), and new ways of interacting. Therapy is also a space to put those newly learned skills to work. 

### Tell your own story

The stories we tell ourselves about our relationships affect the way we view ourselves and our partner(s).

Couples therapy can be a time to talk about that story in your own words and break out of the ideas that keep you stuck in unhelpful ways of relating to your loved one(s).

### Listen and be heard

Couples therapy is a chance to say the things you need to say in a supportive environment.

It's also a chance to listen deeply to your partner.

Listening is an essential tool in our relationships. Only by listening to one another can we respond to our partner's needs.
