## What To Expect from Therapy

My approach to therapy is _humanistic, gender-affirming_, and incorporates elements of _cognitive_ and _narrative therapy_ to challenge ways of thinking and internalized messages which negatively affect our views of ourselves, others, and our world.

In the therapy office, I typically take on a role that is collaborative, active, and engaged, although I tend to avoid leading the session. This is because I believe that therapy centers on _you._ In our hour together, you get the power to decide where the session goes.

My specialty areas include working with queer, trans, and nonbinary individuals and their partners as they navigate identity, transition, relationship issues, and beyond.

### Fees

My full fee is $100 per 50-minute session - HOWEVER in order to help make therapy more accessible, I do offer a sliding scale starting at $60 for those with limited resources.

_While I wish to make my services as accessible as possible, as an Associate therapist I am unable to accept insurance at this time._
