    I am proud to offer gender-affirming therapy services in my community.

    Gender therapy is aimed at assisting individuals who are trans, non-binary, or otherwise questioning or struggling with their gender identity.

    **Are you the partner of a trans person?**

  Questioning your gender identity can be a confusing, whirlwind of uncovered emotions or feelings some describe as opening Pandora's box, or it can be a smoldering feeling that's been with you for as long as you can remember, or even both.

  __In therapy, I aim to support your exploration of these feelings and provide you with the tools to be the person you need to be.__

## Questioning your Gender Identity

Maybe you've never really felt comfortable performing the role of the gender you were assigned at birth. Or maybe you've always been envious of the gendered characteristics that others are born with and just get to have.

Questioning your gender identity can be a confusing, whirlwind of uncovered emotions or feelings some describe as opening Pandora's box, or it can be a smoldering feeling that's been with you for as long as you can remember, or even both.

In therapy, I aim to support your exploration of these feelings and provide you with the tools to be the person you need to be.

## Confronting the world as a trans, non-binary, or gender non-conforming person

If you are trans, non-binary, or gender non-conforming, odds are that you've struggled in a world that continues to treat trans individuals as second-class citizens.

I strongly believe in addressing marginalization during gender therapy in order to support your ability to confront and shine in a world that can be hostile to your existence, and I have a passion for challenging these societal issues outside of therapy in my personal life and the world at large.

## HRT and Surgery Letters

I cannot provide letters for surgery and/or hormone replacement therapy at this time due to my status as an Associate. However, I am happy to refer individuals seeking these letters to the appropriate places.

The following Long Beach resources for trans individuals may be helpful if you are seeking letters:

- [Monica Provence](https://www.therapyden.com/therapist/monica-provence-long-beach-ca), LGBT affirming therapist (and my supervisor)
- [Prospect Therapy](https://www.prospecttherapy.com/hrt-and-gcs-letters), local LGBT affirming therapy practice
- [The Long Beach LGBT Center](https://centerlb.org)

I only recommend trusted colleagues who agree that **gatekeeping sucks.**
