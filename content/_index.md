## What To Expect from Therapy

My approach to therapy is _humanistic, gender-affirming_, and incorporates elements of _cognitive_ and _narrative therapy_ to challenge ways of thinking and internalized messages which negatively impact our views of ourselves, others, and our world.

In the therapy office, I typically assume a role that is collaborative, active, and engaged, with room for the client to lead the session. This is because I believe that therapy centers on _you._ In our hour together, _you_ have the power to decide where the session goes.

Finally, I strive to serve people of all ethnic, racial, and class backgrounds with sensitivity and humility. When I am sitting across the room (or computer screen) from my clients, I always try my best to account for and be aware of my own biases, including my status as an abled, white woman. My populations of interest are queer, trans, and nonbinary individuals and their partners as they navigate identity, transition, relational issues, self-esteem, and beyond.
