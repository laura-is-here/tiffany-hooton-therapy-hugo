I aim to provide all of my clients with a warm, safe, and affirming space to explore their most authentic selves. In our society, trans and queer folx face numerous stressors that may leave them feeling that the systems in place have let them down. This translates to an accumulation of traumatic experiences and relational struggles that lead to feelings of shame, distrust, hurt, and anger. In therapy, I hope to help my clients overcome these feelings while building a sense of empowerment and authenticity, so they feel ready to build meaningful relationships with others and pursue their goals.

After graduating from California State University, Long Beach, with an undergrad degree in sociology, I decided to pursue my Masters of Science in Counseling at California State University, Fullerton. My dual education in both sociology and counselling as well as the obstacles I faced throughout my own life have informed my current therapeutic areas of interest and practice with my clients.
